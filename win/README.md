Build Scripts for SpringOne Platform 2018 - Solace / Spring Cloud Stream Demo

This repo contains  scripts to assist in building the S1P Demo using the Solace Binder.  This is a temporary set of tools until a full CI/CD pipeline is built.  The current version is designed to work in a Windows environment, but additional Linux tools (such as sed and rm) will either need to be installed or replaced with equivalent commands.
